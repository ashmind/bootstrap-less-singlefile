##Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide one single `bootstrap.less`.  

LESS seems to be the only reasonable way to use Bootstrap (e.g. see http://ruby.bvision.com/blog/please-stop-embedding-bootstrap-classes-in-your-html). But Bootstrap only provides combined `bootstrap.css` â€” LESS files are componentized.

While that is useful for Bootstrap development, for projects using Bootstrap it is less needed (especially since I do not really use Bower). So here is a single file.
